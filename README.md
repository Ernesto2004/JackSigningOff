This project was built by Oscar, [Trent](https://github.com/kingtrentiii), and I for the hackathon called HackTheFog.
### Description
An activity that most of us take for granted is solving puzzles. Solving puzzles can help us with a variety of things: It can improve our memory, improve our problem solving skills, increase our iq, improve our mood, lower stress levels, and so much more. This is why we decided to create a puzzle game! Play as Jack, a criminal in jail who is given a once in a year chance to get out of prison if he can solve a few escape rooms. Move boxes, open doors, step on things, pull switches. And then pull even more switches, and move even more boxes. And open more doors, and step on more things, and get the heck out of jail! This is Jack signing off.
### Why did we choose the puzzle topic?
We love the game Portal, and various 2D games, so we decided to make a 2D puzzle game.
### How itâ€™s made
We made the project with [Unity](https://unity.com/), and we coded everything in Visual Studio. We also handrew every art, and recorded our own audio with our microphone
